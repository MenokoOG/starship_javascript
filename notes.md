**Lesson: Exploring the Starship Simulator**

**Introduction:**
Hello aspiring JavaScript developers! Today, we're going to embark on an exciting journey to explore the capabilities of JavaScript by building a Starship Simulator. In this lesson, we'll create a virtual starship equipped with supplies, a crew, and shuttles. The simulator will allow us to perform various actions, such as adding crew members, supplies, and shuttles, and even simulate a mission.

**Objective:**
- Understand how to use JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive application.
- Learn about object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
- Explore event listeners for user interaction.
- Experience DOM manipulation to update and display information on a webpage.

**Prerequisites:**
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax is recommended.

**Setting Up the Starship Simulator:**

1. **HTML Structure:**
   Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) with a basic structure. Include input fields, buttons, and a display area for starship information.

   ```html
   <!-- index.html -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
     <title>Starship Simulator</title>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   </head>
   <body>
     <!-- ... (Input fields, buttons, and display area) -->
     <script src="app.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **CSS Styling:**
   Create a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) to style the starship simulator interface.

   ```css
   /* styles.css */
   body {
     font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
     background-color: #f0f0f0;
     margin: 0;
     padding: 0;
   }

   .container {
     max-width: 800px;
     margin: 20px auto;
     background-color: #fff;
     padding: 20px;
     border-radius: 8px;
     box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
   }

   /* ... (Add more styles as needed) */
   ```

**JavaScript Magic:**

3. **Creating Starship Objects:**
   In `app.js`, we'll start by defining JavaScript classes for Supplies, CrewMember, Shuttle, and the Starship itself.

   ```javascript
   // app.js

   // ... (Supplies, CrewMember, and Shuttle classes)

   class Starship {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
       this.supplies = [];
       this.crew = [];
       this.shuttles = [];
     }

     // ... (Methods for adding supplies, crew, shuttles, and simulating a mission)
   }
   ```

4. **User Interaction:**
   Implement event listeners to capture user input and update the starship accordingly.

   ```javascript
   // app.js

   // ... (Previous code)

   document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
     // ... (Event listeners for ship creation, adding crew, supplies, shuttles, and more)

     // Additional event listeners for displaying information
     showSuppliesBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
       // Display supplies information
     });

     showCrewBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
       // Display crew information
     });

     showShuttlesBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
       // Display shuttles information
     });

     startMissionBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
       // Simulate a mission
     });
   });
   ```

**Lesson Overview:**

1. **Ship Creation:**
   - Users can create a starship by entering a name and clicking a button.
   - JavaScript captures the input, creates a Starship object, and displays a confirmation message.

2. **Adding Crew, Supplies, and Shuttles:**
   - Users can input crew member names and roles, supply names and quantities, and shuttle names.
   - JavaScript creates corresponding objects and adds them to the starship.

3. **Simulating a Mission:**
   - Users can initiate a mission, and JavaScript simulates various activities such as using supplies, performing crew tasks, and launching shuttles.
   - Information about the mission is displayed.

4. **Displaying Information:**
   - Additional buttons allow users to view information about supplies, crew, and shuttles.
   - JavaScript updates the webpage to show the relevant information.

**Conclusion:**
Congratulations! You've now experienced the power of JavaScript in creating an interactive Starship Simulator. This lesson touched on object-oriented programming, event handling, and DOM manipulation. Keep exploring and experimenting with JavaScript to build more exciting projects!
